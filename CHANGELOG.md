# Changelog

## 2026-06-14
- Fix multi-selection in the file and search panels
  - File panel: enable `ExtendedSelection` so multiple files can be selected (previously single-only)
  - Search panel: dragging one of several selected items now drags the whole selection instead of collapsing to the clicked item
    - Pressing an already-selected item kept the view in `NoState`, so the first mouse move was treated as rubber-band selection and overwrote the multi-selection
    - Now the selection is preserved on press and the drag is started manually; a click without dragging still collapses to the single clicked item

## 2026-06-08
- Rewrite tab drag-and-drop with fully custom implementation
  - Disable Qt native movable drag (whose ghost widget cannot be repositioned mid-scroll)
  - Draw dragged tab as a floating copy that follows the cursor at all times
  - In-bounds drag reorders tabs immediately as the floating copy center crosses a neighbor
  - Out-of-bounds drag leapfrogs hidden tabs one at a time via timer (80 ms/step)
  - Hide close button on the dragged tab during drag to avoid layout artifacts
  - Add `scroll_index_into_view` using `arrowType()` to reliably find Left/Right scroll buttons
